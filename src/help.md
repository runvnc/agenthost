# Error Fixes

Here are the solutions to the errors and warnings you're encountering:

1. **Error: expected one of `.`, `;`, `?`, `else`, or an operator, found `;`**

   This error is due to the use of `?` operator in the `add_function` method. The `?` operator is used for error propagation but it's being used in a function that doesn't return a `Result` or `Option`. You should handle the error or change the function to return a `Result` or `Option`.

2. **Warning: unused import: `std::collections::HashMap`**

   This warning is because you've imported `HashMap` but never used it in your code. You can remove this import to fix the warning.

3. **Warning: unused import: `ChatCompletionFunctionsArgs`**

   Similar to the previous warning, you've imported `ChatCompletionFunctionsArgs` but never used it. You can remove this import to fix the warning.

4. **Warning: unused import: `serde_json::json`**

   Again, you've imported `serde_json::json` but never used it. You can remove this import to fix the warning.

5. **Error: cannot move out of `self.functions` which is behind a shared reference**

   This error is because you're trying to move `self.functions` while it's behind a shared reference. In Rust, you can't move out of borrowed content. You should pass a reference to `self.functions` instead of moving it. Replace `self.functions` with `&self.functions` in the `create_chat_request` method.
