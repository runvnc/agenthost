# Analysis

The two programs provided are implementations of a chatbot using the OpenAI API. The first one is written in Rust and the second one in JavaScript. They both perform similar tasks but with slight differences.

## Rust Program (main.rs)

The Rust program uses the `async_openai` library to create a chatbot. It sends a message to the OpenAI API and then listens for the response. The response is streamed and each chunk of the response is written to stdout as it comes in. However, it does not keep track of the full response or the function calls.

## JavaScript Program (askchat.js)

The JavaScript program uses the `openai-streams` library to create a chatbot. Similar to the Rust program, it sends a message to the OpenAI API and listens for the response. The response is also streamed and each chunk of the response is written to stdout as it comes in. However, unlike the Rust program, it keeps track of the full response (`content`) and the function calls (`function_call`).

# Plan

To adapt the Rust program to also track and return the final values of the response and the function calls, we need to make the following changes:

1. Create variables to store the full response and the function calls.
2. Inside the loop where each chunk of the response is processed, append the chunk to the appropriate variable.
3. After the loop, return the variables containing the full response and the function calls.
