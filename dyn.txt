pub fn into_shared(self) -> Self
Turn the Dynamic value into a shared Dynamic value backed by an Rc<RefCell<Dynamic>> or Arc<RwLock<Dynamic>> depending on the sync feature.

Not available under no_closure.

Shared Dynamic values are relatively cheap to clone as they simply increment the reference counts.

Shared Dynamic values can be converted seamlessly to and from ordinary Dynamic values.

If the Dynamic value is already shared, this method returns itself.
